# How to use

Visit [Releases](https://github.com/ZakisM/bl3_save_edit/releases) and download the corresponding version for your
platform.

Unzip and open the editor, then double click to run it. On the first start it will ask you to point it to the
folder/directory where your saves/profiles are stored. Once you have pointed it to a valid folder it will remember this
folder the next time you open the program.

# Notices

The editor will make backups for you before saving your files, but I recommend you make your own backups just in case.

# Building from scratch

First you must install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Then, clone the project and run:

`cargo build`

For a release optimized build run:

`cargo build --release`
